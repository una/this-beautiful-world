I still smell like the sea. Hanging a damp swimsuit on the edge of my hostel bunk in Iceland seems pretty ironic. But it's dark now, which won't last long, and I'm trying not to wake my roommates. The soft scent of sunscreen and slight salt is teasing me as I've just washed the last of the Adriatic out from my hair. The sulfur fought the salt and I don't really know who won.

It's disorienting to be in a new time zone unexpectedly.

I've been in 3 today -- my favorite being when time felt like time was going in reverse. An empty cove with water so clear we saw right through to the bottom -- rocks and spiky black sea urchins smiling up at us everywhere. I've gotten too close once before and still have the faintly freckled fingers to prove it. Light purple dots, stingers we can't remove.

But here is where I want to stay. My favorite spot on the Dalmatian. Eating tomato cream cheese and rotisserie chicken sandwiches on baguettes that we brought here on the boat we rented -- 5 of us -- 4 new friends: American, German, Australian, and Kiwi toasting Mimosas with nobody else around because we came here in the wrong season.

And I swear we were meant to stay there forever but the sky got angry, and the mist rolled in, and our motor fell off twice on the way back to the main island.

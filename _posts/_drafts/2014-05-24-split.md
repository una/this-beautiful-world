I was in Split for a second. And as we walked toward the Old Town, the night's minutes slowly ticked backward into hours into days and years and suddenly we found ourselves: not lost, not found, but in Diecletians retirement home. Sounds like a funny concept doesn't it? An emperors once secret grounds now filled us with wine and live music and the entire square of ordinary people sang along. Old people, young people, happy people -- people who had walked from Finland, who had hitchhiked to Croatia, living off the land and working along the way. People with nothing, people with a lot of things, people whose names I'll never know. But we were all sharing in this moment, singing The Beatles, our voices reverberating against the cream colored columns, and imagining ourselves in a different place in time. The second passed, and we were in Hvar in the morning.

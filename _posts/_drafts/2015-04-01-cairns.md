Little mouths, nibling rocks, and looking up at me like "Why are you staring. Is there something in my teeth?" The Great Barrier Reef. Colorful crustacieans, finger fish frolicking around in formation, some small, some big. Some really, really big:

Calf-sized and covered in a spectrum of reflective light. Rainbows rose off massive swimming butterflies -- elegant yet eccentric. Deep aqua and purple hues blend with flourescent orange stripes. Patterns propping up in waves and jelly fish floating around like gatekeepers.

From deep aqua with purple hues to fluorescent orange stripes, and every shade/pattern in between. Pastel unicorn fish with protruding noses and only partial cares. Laying in the sun all day, wondering how so many beautiful things can exist, and why we're ruining them.

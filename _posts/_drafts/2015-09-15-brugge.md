A winding, windy fairyland &mdash; an epic of extremes: I arrived inside a poem inside a storm.

An hour train ride &mdash; silent, alone, simply watching rain streak by my window, listening to all the words I couldn't understand. Pretty words, but pretty meaningless to me. And pretty confused when the train stopped. Where was I? A little lost.

Found my way only to lose my umbrella and found myself again lost in my thoughts while sitting at the edge of a canal, watching the sun peek over storm clouds onto the still water and past a little stone bridge. There were swans. Fucking swans. Of course there were swans.

There were also flowers blooming, and vines creeping up over ancient stone buildings in the most perfect way. Fall was coming, the leaves were turning yellow, and I was completely in a trance. This place is unreal.

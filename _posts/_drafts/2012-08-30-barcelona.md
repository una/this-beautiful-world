Dear Barcelona,

Thank you for saving me from the smoky grey flood of Amsterdam. As soon as I stepped off that autobus, I felt your sunshine wrap my arms and toes in giggling warmth and white on yellow paint. And thus I walked for hours each day. You kept me smiling with radiantly colorful skulls, shining mosaic benches, and dancing/singing fountains, so I sang back to you (I hope you liked it).

I hope you liked my dancing as much as I liked the beat of your music at night — and the rambling, wide streets filled with people and noise and celebratory spending. The ability to practicar mi español while seeking seafood paella. The three random rallies I didn't quite understand. Under the influence of 87 eurocent wine, the Fins, Argentinians, and Aussies all agreed, and sang with me: Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad.

Barcelona, I was so sad to go. How could I let Florence break us up when we were just getting to know each other?! But don't worry — I left my keys and sunglasses on the counter, so I'll be back soon to pick those up. I miss you.

Love,
Una

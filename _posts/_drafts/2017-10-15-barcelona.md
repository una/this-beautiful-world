I still see Barcelona as an escape from reality, as its escaping itself.

It’s lightness and color, sunshine and pastel mosaics on high reaching buildings.

It’s a gentle breeze on a rooftop, drinking sangria and looking down on men soliciting six-packs of Estella on the street to students.

It’s palm trees standing tall and relaxed, drinking in the sun above people rushing around tourists standing in the middle of the street to take photos, it’s lines.

It’s denied entries and discovered alcoves.  Discovered secret rooms in secret bars. The inside is always more beautiful, especially when unexpected. 

Always go inside. Expect nothing and receive everything.

It’s watching lightning from a hilltop instead of stars, saying this constellation is just fine.

Barcelona is a mosaic of thoughts and ideas. Shining benches covered in visitors. They’re ants. 

Dalí warned us.

It’s calamity and calm. It’s effervescent.

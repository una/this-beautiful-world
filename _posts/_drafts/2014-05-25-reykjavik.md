I can't write about Iceland
without thinking of you,
And how you'd kiss my neck
in our little white room.
The way that we laughed
when we found the right ranch;
We stayed in someone's backyard
and you made all the plans.
Driving the Circle for hours,
stopped to walk on black sand,
I traced puffin track footprints
while you were holding my hand.
Tectonic plates parted
and formed quiete the rift.
We were little explorers
as we skipped along it.
We watched the blue Geyser,
I watched your blue eyes,
breathed steam in lagoons &mdash;
drank White Russians at night.
We saw corrugated steel
from the tops of grey towers,
When the sun didn't sleep
for twenty-one hours.
That was when I could trust you
and before all your lies.
But at least you'll have Iceland
to remember me by.

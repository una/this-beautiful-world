I understand this place from a distance, and so I think I can appreciate its ludicracy. Shaking my head at every turn, shaking my head at the grand, glamorous, grungy buildings. A devastated mess made of a communist ruler's wet dream.

Such juxtaposition.

Ornate crown moulding on marble, pushing a river under a road to build a graffiti-covered street wider than the Champs-Élysées, filled with old cars pushing carbon into the air. Pushing people out of homes, pushing so they don’t push back, this place was built on leveled neighborhoods with hammers and sickles.

In the quaint churches I wandered, filled with gilded panels containing illustrated saints. Stood solemnly independent. No sitting, just kneeling, and starting to get back up again.

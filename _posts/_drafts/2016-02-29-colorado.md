Looking up, I've never see the stars so clear at night. Whole constellations&mdash;Orion in full detail, hid nothing. Whispered worries over steam and steady fingers over stems fighting wind to keep it from winning. It did. We lost a glass, switched to plastic, and eventually just drank from the bottle. But stayed out and stared at stars until our toes pruned and the clouds came to say goodnight.

Looking out, seven friends over a frozen lake breathing cold, fresh mountain air. And we mostly survived&mdash;made it back in one piece, though like the wine glasses, some were more fractured than others. Still smiling, sitting down on the kitchen floor with Thai food, or laying spread out on the potentially heated carpet, sharing space with dead flies and looking up at a gold moose head, stretching something.

Looking back at early nights and early mornings. Early drives through sleepy mining towns turned gambling halls. Staring up at rocks and ridges from the very back seat, craning my neck to look up further. Green trees, blue skies, and white peaks broke up the red pallet of our coats. Flying down a mountain and watching the landscape fly by too. A really colorful dream, flanked by looking up at the stars at night, remembering just how small we really are.

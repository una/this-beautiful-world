Chorni. Black.. Black hills.. Black. Hmm.. A Black broken Croatian understanding of my broken Cyrillic upbringing. Fumbling GPS in a foreign tongue while clutching a hand-me-down map, thinking "I'm definitely not telling my mother about this".

Where was I going and Why? I honestly didn't even know. I didn't stop to ask. Just joined an American girl and German boy with a promise of adventure. And we got along well. More than just well. Three wanderlust-driven humans who just wanted to explore.

We drove down the winding Croatian coast. We drove through war-torn countries and small sleepy seaside towns, ate by buildings with casual bullet holes, and dipped our toes in abandoned beaches. 

We drove until the clouds came out and shadowed the sun -- into an eerie silent scene, a stage set for ominous dark landforms to slowly grow above us as we continued onward. From the back seat I looked up in wonder. Amazed. An absolutely silent sea and giant black mountains jutting upward. Black Mountains--an epiphany!

The mood lightened quickly, as did the day.

Soon we were singing wagon wheel and smiling. We all learned the words in a remote mountain town outside of Kotor. And how could I ever forget them now?

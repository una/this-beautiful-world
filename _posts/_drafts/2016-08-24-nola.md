You: behind the wheel, smiling at me, smiling at you.
I would have treasured this more if I knew it wasn't going to last forever,

A sense of wonder with you.
We had to try everything, go everywhere, build something together.

New Orleans creeped up on us. It felt like we were driving through a swamp, and then suddenly there it was. The smell of beignets, our cute little pink townhouse with art that hung for sale inside.

Jazz on every street. Marching bands and brass, umbrellas over heads to shield them from the sun. Sitting on the corner I wanted to dance. But you didn't want to dance. I pushed and you pulled.

And we yelled at each other in this beautiful place. Creole backdrop and two enamored kids screaming their lungs out at each other between French 75's and Sazeracs and Hurricanes.

We were the hurricane. And we were coming apart.

We knew it but denied it because this was so intense and good when it was good and we were best friends and partners and we were so in love and will we ever feel *this* in love with anybody ever again?

It seemed unlikely.

I thought about how much I loved you when we sat and drank wine at the edge of town, listening to a live music, feeling like we were home, and smiling at you smiling at me.

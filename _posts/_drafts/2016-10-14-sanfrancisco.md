Brisk morning walks through fog over the marina, and I'm struggling with my sunglasses on. Brunch and basking in the sun in Dolores, driving up and down steep streets. I could never drive here -- eyes wide at the cars and hills, and streets that turn into stairs.

Trams, rainbows on hilltop parks overlooking the city, food. So much food, and a tiki bar with a waterfall inside, a wine bar with a piano, a restaurant bar where we ordered way too much food. But we made friends.

San Francisco is always full of friends. And always a juxtaposition of fame and famine, warm and cold. And always calling itself mild.

This place is anything but mild.

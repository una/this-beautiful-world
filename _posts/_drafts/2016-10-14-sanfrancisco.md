Brisk morning walks through fog over the marina, and I'm struggling with my sunglasses on. Brunch and basking in the sun in Dolores, driving up and down steep streets. I could never drive here -- these cars terrify me

- tram cars, rainbows on hilltop parks overlooking the city, food, so much food, and a tiki bar with a waterfall inside

san francisco is full of friends

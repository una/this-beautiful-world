I really loved my short trip here.
The small blonde girl who walked me around the only 24-hour grocery after massive 2 AM burgers to make sure I picked out all of the right candy bars to take home.

Sweeter than I expected

It rained every day,
But it felt fitting, and it felt right,
And I felt right at home here.

It was cold,
But much warmer than New York 
because everyone glowed, radiant.

They're radiant, Estonians.
Old town, new tech, brimming with ideas.
“We’re not Eastern Europe, we’re Northern Europe”

Going the distance to build distance.

All I wanted to do was drink and sing.

So we drank and sang.

Dark beer and light rain. Chilly grey days led us to warm crowded pubs light by dim yellow lamps, and full of older women explaining to me that the toilets don't flush -- and they havent in eighteen years.

Stepping outside to polish off our pints and pay attention to the uneven streets of Temple Bar, recalling the portraits that followed us with their eyes. Watching the crowd.

Cheers. Nighttime commotion and daytime calm, touring castles and cathedrals from the outside because we didn't have a lot of time.

We didn't have a lot of time until this ended. We sat on the floor of our hostel, holding Kinder egg bunnies and trying not to think about goodbye. We'd have to say bye to each other and hello to uncertainty.

So we drank and sang.

#Amsterdam

<p class="poem">
  <span class="green">Endless bubbles, a fish in an aquarium inside of a coffee shop, and everything was green: my first steps in Europe. Navigating crooked streets lettered with accents; maps lettered with flourishes I could only appreciate for their aesthetics. "Where am I?" I asked more than once.</span>

  <span class="grey">We went on a scavenger hunt, seeking a landmark to locate us. The traffic was heavy, but roads were safer than streets. Teenage girls on iPhones on bicycles locked on bicycles, four rows deep. Tripping on gears and peddles to get through, just tripping.</span>

  <span class="yellow">Everything was yellow. Cheese crepes and cheese stores and cheese flavors I never would­ have thought up &mdash; pesto, peppered, pineapple. Guiltlessly strolling and sampling each one twice; a bit of stroopvaffel for dessert, then walking a block and doing it all over again.</span>

  <span class="blue">Bumping into skyscraper men with big blue eyes. Soccer coach. We stayed out till five, dodging around sketchy corners, graffitied gates of stores in dark alleys with names that meant nothing to me. And he didn’t really either, but I liked that everything was blue and I felt strangely secure.</span>

  <span class="red">Cantering crooked canals, we stopped when we knew we were there. Everything was red. Embarrassed or empowered women in stockings stared at us staring at them. We were prodding, peering into their cubbies, feeling the color pulsing off of my hands, as if I were guilty of something. And I almost was.</span>
  </p>
  <span class="last">I slept the whole way to Barcelona.</span>

#Amsterdam

Endless bubbles, a fish in an aquarium inside of a coffee shop, and everything was green: my first steps in Europe. Navigating crooked streets lettered with accents; maps lettered with flourishes I could only appreciate for their aesthetics. “Where am I?” I asked more than once.

We went on a scavenger hunt, seeking a landmark to locate us. The traffic was heavy, but roads were safer than streets. Teenage girls on iPhones on their bicycles locked on bicycles, four rows deep. Tripping on gears and peddles to get through, just tripping.

Everything was yellow. Cheese crepes and cheese stores and cheese flavors I never would­ have thought up; pesto, peppered, pineapple. Guiltlessly strolling and sampling each one twice; a bit of stroopvaffel for dessert, then walking a block and doing it all over again.

Bumping into skyscraper men with big blue eyes. He was the goalie coach of the women’s national soccer team. We stayed out till five, dodging around sketchy corners, graffitied gates of stores in dark alleys with names that meant nothing to me. And he didn’t really either, but I liked that everything was blue and I felt strangely secure.

Cantering crooked canals, we stopped when we knew we were there. Everything was red. Embarrassed or empowered women in stockings stared at us staring at them. Poking, prodding, peering into their little cubbies, feeling the color pulsing off of my hands, as if I were guilty of something. And I almost was.

I slept the whole way to Barcelona.

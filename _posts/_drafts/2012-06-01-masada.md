Ashkelon:

Midnight in a sister city of my own: I found myself on a quiet street, sneaking out with our Israelies to find a little beach bar. There was nothing around. No noise, no commotion, just us on the streets, and opening the door we discovered where everyone was.

It was loud in there. Really loud. And full of life: warm hues cast by dim lights, hurried hebrew and laughter. The boys bought us beers and we began our own chatter until we heard a crash and then I remembered where I was.

A waiter had spilled a tray, and in no time at all, a roar amongst the crowd: "L'Chaim!"

Not a single person hesitated. Not a single person didn't join in. Not a single person stopped their conversation from before the crash. Normality is relative: what a wonderful world.

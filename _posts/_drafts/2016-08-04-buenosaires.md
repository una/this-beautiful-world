The language barrier was real, but it was my fault. I remember trying to accomplish simple tasks&mdash;buying a sube card&mdash;two girls at the corner store trying to translate "do you want cards charge cash card." They played it aloud for the store to hear and laughed.

It rained, but that didn't stop the endless buffet of meats and chimichuri. I tried to order a salad and got a meat dish with some lettuce underneath. But I found some solace and some pan de queso, in a place I'm embarrassed to admit.

Palermo street shopping and mostly just admiring. Hopping from storefront to storefront to get out of the rain. I got out for a foggy day to visit the neighbors across the river.

When you're running and running and suddenly stop&mdash;and the whole world seems to fall into place.

Vignettes of a city below us: staring at stacked blue lights and white owl eyes, wondering where all the cars are going.

Who are you? Where are you going? Where am I going?

Life does this to us&mdash;the kids who live on whims and maps and know that if you just buy a ticket, everything else will fall into place.

And I really fell into this place.

I fell into a state of comfort in my little safe haven: a yellow room that led out to sunsets over the cityscape. Big bed to come home to, being guided by a warm breeze each time I stepped out of the airplane.

Music, everywhere, always. That funk band at Stay Gold, jazzy blues on South Congress, and even bass-driven quartet covers over coffee&mdash;that's where I really lived. In between wifi networks and bike lanes&mdash;always going somewhere else.

But right now, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just sitting up here, watching cars, enjoying the company, and silently wondering where everyone else is going.

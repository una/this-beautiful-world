Wildly bright flowers peeking over Lake Geneva, stretching up toward the sun in front of snow-capped mountains. The scene was so serene. I walked alone for hours, breathing in crisp air, and listening to the humble still sound of the sea. Explored little parks and came upon children playing in the crystaline water in front of Ch√¢teau de Chillon, an elegant stone eagle, perched by the water. Everything was still, calm, and tranquil. Everything was at peace.

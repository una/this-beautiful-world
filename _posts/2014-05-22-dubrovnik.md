<h1 class="city">Dubrovnik, Croatia</h1>

<div class="poem">
<p>
<strong>In the morning, I had plans.</strong> I was going to stay here a while, and explore this beautiful, venerable town on the coast. Eat fish with bones in it, and feel like I was walking the streets of Kings. After all, I was. Orange rooftops, a calm sea, and a hint of saline in the breeze: it could be worse.
<br>
Three days turned into one day when I found myself drinking wine out of a teacup, wearing a cowboy hat, and rejecting a marriage proposal. The entire hostel was there. We made friends fast.
<br>
The city was silent and empty and beautiful. The bars had all long been closed, but we walked to the dock, outside the walls of this ancient, stone-lined city, and sat, passing around a cheap plastic fourty that someone had abandoned. A circle of strangers, sharing intimate stories, and listening to cat mafias making calls to their clans: mischievously planning to take over the town.
<br>
That's the last time I knew where I was going to sleep at night for a while. But I swear, <strong>in the morning, I had plans.</strong>

Paris, Paris, you were so cold to me; judgmental, biting at my nose with wind. You closed your metro before I could ride home on Christmas, and I walked the whole way to my hostel. So strange when the French police kick you out of the station on a holiday. Strange paths at night; bicyclers looked at me, wondered who this little girl was, strange, as 3AM slipped by and I was still wandering their city. At least I wasn't alone. You're never alone when you travel alone.

Croque Monsieur and crepes: that's all I could afford. Sixty US Dollars to my name and making friends with belly dancers and chefs to go out into the city, explore, tour Montmartre, stand in the cold. We saw the Moulon Rouge but couldn't go in: couldn't afford it. Luckily I was able to slip into the Louvre by the Lion to take a selfie with Mona.

    Everything in a fog.
  </p>
  <p>
    Took a ferry in a fog, walked by the sea in a fog, climbed a lighthouse in the fog. Palm trees covered in a fog, buildings painted pastel by the fog.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only bright bulb was an orange punch buggy in the middle of the street. One of the few cars around.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there were plenty of loud birds and neighborhood dogs, winding streets both Portugese and Spanish. Plenty of options&mdash;you can get pesos or dollars out of the ATMs here. And plenty of rain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting out from the rain in a little restaurant by the sea&mdash;Buen Suspiro, number 92. Eating local cheese and drinking local wine with a friend I made on her way to the Olympic games. What a fascinating life we lead.
  </p>
  <p>
    I emerged from the fog with a little matcha mug, and that was that.

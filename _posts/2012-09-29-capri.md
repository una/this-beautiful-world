I’m shaking, trembling, feeling my ticking spine shifting
Left to right, retreating and repeating: I can do this.

Keep your body taught, keep your legs together, keep your head forward,
Keep your arms tucked in, keep your back straight, keep your calm.
How can they expect me to remember so many things when
one goes, two go, three jump off the mountain we climb to get here.
There’s no place to turn, no way to down that steep cliff now.

I slipped twice getting here,
My shins pricked by thorns as I crawled up the narrow stones,
My fingertips clinging onto the sharp rocks above me,
Pulling me as my feet pushed off of biting shards,
edging themselves between the crevices of my toes.

My whole body is rejecting this idea I had in my head.
I feel like my heart beating up here is audible to the entire island,
To the crystal blue water, dancing light circling my eyes,
Sun overhead beating on white cliffs: stunning. Stunning me.
I feel like my legs won’t let me move and my lungs won’t let me breathe.
I’m  counting down in my head, then starting over.
Fuck it. Let’s go.

Nearly naked skin wrapped in a cozy blanket of rays
As I sit, leaning on a staircase that leads to a tangerine colored boutique.
Lemon oil and freshly pressed citrus, candles awaken
the corners of my lips toward the source of my warmth.
What a beautiful, beautiful place.
Limoncello in a cliffside caf√©, sitting over the Salerno,
The water is warm, and with rocks, hot from the sun, we play spa.

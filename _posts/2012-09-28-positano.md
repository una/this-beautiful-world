    <p>Nearly naked skin wrapped in a cozy blanket of rays
    As I sit, leaning on a staircase that leads to a tangerine colored boutique.
    Lemon oil and freshly pressed citrus, candles awaken
    the corners of my lips toward the source of my warmth.
    What a beautiful, beautiful place.
    Limoncello in a cliffside caf√©, sitting over the Salerno,
    The water is warm, and with rocks, hot from the sun, we play spa.

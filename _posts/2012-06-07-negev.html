<p class="poem">
We sat on floors, slept on mats, and braided each others hair. Speaking slowly, repeating swear words for the nuances in their pronunciations. Eating like family, speaking like friends. It was warm where we slept but the air outside was frigid.
<br>
Stepping outside to watch the sun rise in the desert. We fought our alarms, and nudged each other awake because promises were made. And there it was.
<br>
I felt the sound of simple silence after so many sounding circles. The absence of noise and humidity. Lost in thoughts of prayers to see more sun rises. This was the first time I traveled alone and knew it wouldn't be my last. I caught the bug.

<h1 class="location">Berlin, Germany</h1>
<h2 class="date">December 2012</h2>

<p class="poem">
<mark>Lights, loud music, those electricity balls you'd find at Spencer's. This basement is something I wasn't ready for: a room so full of smoke that I have no idea how big it is, or who is standing in front of me. All I see are lights, flashes of color, hands, lights, afterimages, beating against my eyes and ears and vibrating through my body, into my spine. All I can see are hands.
<br>
Hands.
<br>
Hands. Green. Purple. Yellow. Red. Hands.
<br>
I have no control over my eyes, my body, or my surroundings.
<br>
Black. White. Red. Purple.
<br>
Music blasting out of its speakers, boldly escaping its cell and beating out any particles that dare hang around the air. Everyone jumping, swaying, fighting the vibrations.
<br>
Is this my body?
<br>
Spiked hair and torn t-shirts. That's all I can see. The Danish girls I came here with had already headed upstairs. But I stay, feeling the walls shaking, and still trying to see past the smoke, I close my eyes.
<br>
"So, this is Berlin," I'm thinking.
<br>
It's insane. Absolutely insane. I see the pulse of the music in the lights and i'm not sure what my body is doing, what it looks like, where I am. 
<br>
<br>
I shrug, and pulse along.</mark>

<mark>Lights, loud music, those electricity balls you'd find at Spencer's. This basement is something I wasn't ready for: true and honest techno. A room so full of smoke that I have no idea how big it was, or who is standing in front of me. All I see are lights, flashes of color, hands, lights, afterimages, beat against my eyes and ears and vibrate through my body, into my spine. All I can see are hands.
<br>
Hands.
<br>
Hands.
<br>
Green. Purple. Yellow. Red.
<br>
Hands.
<br>
I have no control over my eyes, my body, or my surroundings.
<br>
Black. White. Red. Purple.
<br>
Music blasting out of its speakers, boldly escaping its cell and beating out any particles that dare hang around the air. Everyone jumping, swaying, fighting the vibrations.
<br>
Is this my body?
<br>
Spiked hair and punk t-shirts. That's all I can see. The Copenhagen-American girls I came here with had already headed upstairs. But I stay, feeling the walls shaking, and still trying to see past the smoke. I close my eyes.
<br>
"This is Berlin," I'm thinking.
<br>
Alternative. It's insane. Absolutely insane. I see the pulse of the music in the lights. I don't know what my body was doing. I am clubbing in Berlin.</mark></p>

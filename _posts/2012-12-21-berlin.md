Lights, loud music, those electricity balls you'd find at Spencer's. This basement is something I wasn't ready for: true and honest techno. A room so full of smoke that I had no idea how big it was, or who was standing in front. All I saw were lights, flashes of color, hands, lights, afterimages, beat against my eyes and ears and vibrated through my body intro my spine. All I could see were hands.

Hands.

Hands.

Green. Purple. Yellow. Red.

Hands.

I had no control over my eyes, my body, or my surroundings.

Black. White. Red. Purple.

Music blasting out of its speakers, boldly escaping its cell and beating out any particles that hung around the air. Everyone jumping, swaying, fighting the vibrations.

Is this my body?

Spiked hair and punk t-shirts. That's all I can see. The Copenhagen-American girls I came here with had already headed upstairs. But I stayed, feeling the walls shaking, and still trying to see past the smoke. I closed my eyes.

"This is Berlin," I thought.

Alternative. It was insane. Absolutely insane. I saw the pulse of the music in the lights. I didn't know what my body was doing. I was clubbing in Berlin.

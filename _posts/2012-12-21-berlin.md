Lights, loud music, those electricity balls you'd find at Spencer's. This basement is something I wasn't ready for: true and honest techno. A room so full of smoke that I have no idea how big it was, or who is standing in front of me. All I see are lights, flashes of color, hands, lights, afterimages, beat against my eyes and ears and vibrate through my body, into my spine. All I can see are hands.

Hands.

Hands.

Green. Purple. Yellow. Red.

Hands.

I have no control over my eyes, my body, or my surroundings.

Black. White. Red. Purple.

Music blasting out of its speakers, boldly escaping its cell and beating out any particles that dare hang around the air. Everyone jumping, swaying, fighting the vibrations.

Is this my body?

Spiked hair and punk t-shirts. That's all I can see. The Copenhagen-American girls I came here with had already headed upstairs. But I stay, feeling the walls shaking, and still trying to see past the smoke. I close my eyes.

"This is Berlin," I'm thinking.

Alternative. It's insane. Absolutely insane. I see the pulse of the music in the lights. I don't know what my body was doing. I am clubbing in Berlin.

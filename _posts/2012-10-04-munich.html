    <p class="poem">
      In this plastic town
      pink plastic homes are lined with bright red petunias
      peeking out of window boxes onto the street below,
      where bells clink on Clydstales, adorned in silver and blue bows
      <br>
      to carry kegs down the street.
      Chubby-faced cheery children run around, cheeks red,
      Stealing sips from Papa’s stein.
      Women dressed in drindles, dolls in pigtails, heeled boots,
      <br>
      And men in leather leiderhosen, bellys hanging out
      of the bottoms of their plaid shirts,
      pretending to be modern day Hansels and Gretels.
      Sharing umbrellas and moonshine with strangers.
      Sharing songs, pronunciations, words, slurs, laughs
      On top of tables, stomping to the beat
      Of five thousand drunk and happy people:
      <span class="highlight">Ein Prosit! Ein Prosit!</span>
      <span class="flr">Bavaria welcomed us to it’s party with open arms.</span>

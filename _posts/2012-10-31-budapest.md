Flashlight on hardhat, here I climb down into small crevices of caves, seeking at least five hundred ways to say this place is extraordinary. We turn off the lights and sit in a moment of silent darkness like nothing I've ever experienced, my eyes playing tricks and shaping words into my ears. But none of the words come close to describing this.

Serenity and Cinderella's castle  stand by a white marble walkway, watching over brightly colored chevron roofs. Green and orange and yellow patches, I am truly alone in Europe for the first time. Watching the clouds drift and dance around a charming church nestled in Castle Square. Looking up to its tall white bas relief panels, like fingerprints, each incredible inch of this city.

Grand gargoyles gaping from the Opera House make Parliament's pretty porcelain facade blush a soft rose. The delicate doll of Budapest, bluntly bruised where a Marxist mark once hung.

Acclimated, it commemorates heroes on horses on the tops of tall podiums. The air biting, refreshing after sitting in hot sulfur baths of a pastel yellow bath house. It is proud and bold and sharp — a dainty hidden gem — a blood diamond.

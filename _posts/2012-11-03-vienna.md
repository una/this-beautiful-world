Golden, gilded, and glorious,<br>
You amaze me with your glittering streets,<br>
chimes for Mozart and warm roasted walnuts<br>
with Sacher chocolate torte; pumpkin spice lattes.<br>
A library as big as a mansion and much more elaborate.<br>
Ballerinas dancing around billboards by<br>
the royal palace where Marie Antoinette and her<br>
six sisters grew up. I felt as though I should be<br>
donning a glittering ball gown, or lacey silk gloves<br>
for the duration of my stay.<br>

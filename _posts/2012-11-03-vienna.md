Golden, gilded, and glorious,
You amaze me with your glittering streets,
chimes for Mozart and warm roasted walnuts
with Sacher chocolate torte; pumpkin spice lattes.
A library as big as a mansion and much more elaborate.
Ballerinas dancing around billboards by
the royal palace where Marie Antoinette and her
six sisters grew up. I felt as though I should be
donning a glittering ball gown, or lacey silk gloves
for the duration of my stay.

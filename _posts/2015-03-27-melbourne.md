  I can only look back on it with a smile on my face. The first thing that comes to mind is a big light-up sign: Baller. Then: jumping images, lights, strange green cafes closing.

  <br>
  <span>"Are these plants real?"</span><br>

  Corner-store ice cream fueled midnight chatter while we sat in bean bag chairs, nerding out. Laughing about being too British to ask for a spoon.
  <br>
  There were lights and rooftops. A lot of rooftops. Seven sets of stairs to the cinema where we spilled Sangria and snickered. Planning our emergency exit: those small unremarkably memorable conversations.
  <br>
  Cheerful accents were the chorus and I was dancing along behind a borrowed orange sun hat. I love Australia, and I love Australians more.
  <br>
  <span>"Can I tether your connection? I need to find a place to stay tomorrow"</span>
  <br>
  I don't think I wore enough black.

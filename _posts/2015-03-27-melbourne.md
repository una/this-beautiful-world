  <p class="poem">
  I can only look back on it with a smile on my face. The first thing that comes to mind is a big light-up sign: Baller. Then: jumping images, strange green cafes closing, Magnums fueling midnight chatter, sitting in bean bags, nerding out.
  <br>
  There were lights and rooftops. A lot of rooftops. Seven sets of stairs to the cinema where we spilled Sangria and snickered. Planning our emergency exit: those small unremarkably memorable conversations.
  <br>
  Cheerful accents were the chorus I was dancing along behind a borrowed orange sun hat. I love Australia, and I love Australians more.

  I don't think I wore enough black.

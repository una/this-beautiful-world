<p class="poem">
Seal searching and finding serenity by bright wild flowers: pink and violet: red and green and white. Some yellow like I'd imagine the sun: stretching out slowly, vinyasinya by the docs, slowly wrapping me up. <span>I feel the love.</span>

It's just beautiful here. Marinas and tall trees emerging from hazy air; smoke from wild fires and new friends. <span>I feel the love.</span>

Heading away from Canada and toward big, clear windows. To fish-throwing and gum-ridden walls lining a tiny alleyway full of tourists. The salmon is impecable and gamey. Totem pole culture surrounding a park full of Polka and cheers. Chocolate-covered banana falling onto my lap as we cheer, too.<span>I feel the love.</span>

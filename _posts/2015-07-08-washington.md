  Seal searching and finding serenity by brightly colored wild flowers: pink and violet: red and green and white. Some yellow, sunshine stretching out slowly, yoga by the docks. Yellow, slowly wrapping me up. <span>I feel the love.</span>
  <br>
  There's a dusky beauty here. Marinas and tall trees emerging from hazy air; smoke from wild fires and new friends. <span>I feel the love.</span>
  <br>
  Heading away from Canada and toward big, clear windows. To fish-throwing and gum-ridden walls lining a tiny alleyway full of tourists. Try the salmon. Totem pole culture surrounding a park full of Polka and cheers. A chocolate-covered banana falling onto my lap as we cheer, too. <span>I feel the love.</span>
